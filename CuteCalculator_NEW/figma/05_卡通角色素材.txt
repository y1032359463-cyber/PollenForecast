Design cute cat character illustrations with 4 different emotional states AND animated arms for a calculator app:

## Character Dimensions
- Canvas size: 300×300px (@3x scale, 900×900px actual)
- Export as: PNG with transparent background
- Style: cute, cartoon, friendly

## Layered Character Design (IMPORTANT)
- **TWO SEPARATE LAYERS** for animation support:
  1. **Body layer** (cat_xxx_body.png): head, face, torso (STATIC)
  2. **Arms layer** (cat_xxx_arms.png): both arms with hands (ANIMATED)

## Character Design Specifications
- Animal: Cat (cute, round face, with visible arms/hands)
- Color scheme: warm orange-pink tones (#FF8C42 to #FFB3C1)
- Body: simple, minimalist style with VISIBLE ARMS
- Eyes: large, expressive
- Arms: short, cute, positioned at sides (ready to move up/down)
- Hands: small, rounded paws
- Overall style: kawaii/cute aesthetic, suitable for all ages

## Arm Animation Design
- Arms should be drawn in **neutral position** (slightly raised)
- Design allows for up/down movement (20-30px range)
- Both arms move together symmetrically
- Movement simulates "pressing button" gesture

## Four Emotional States

### 1. Normal State (cat_normal.png)
- Expression: happy, content, smiling
- Eyes: open, bright, cheerful
- Mouth: slight smile
- Body language: relaxed, welcoming
- Use case: default state, waiting for input

### 2. Calculating State (cat_calculating.png)
- Expression: thinking, concentrating
- Eyes: slightly squinted or looking up-right
- Mouth: small "o" shape or pursed
- Additional element: small "?" or thought bubble
- Body language: engaged, focused
- Use case: during calculation, processing

### 3. Result State (cat_result.png)
- Expression: excited, happy, successful
- Eyes: wide open, sparkling
- Mouth: big smile or "^_^"
- Additional element: small stars or sparkles around head
- Body language: joyful, celebrating
- Use case: showing successful calculation result

### 4. Error State (cat_error.png)
- Expression: confused, puzzled, concerned
- Eyes: wide, surprised or dizzy (spirals optional)
- Mouth: "o" shape (surprised)
- Additional element: small sweat drop or question marks
- Body language: apologetic, uncertain
- Use case: calculation error or invalid input

## Color Specifications
- Primary fur color: #FF8C42 (warm orange)
- Secondary details: #FFB3C1 (soft pink)
- Accents: #FFFFFF (white for highlights)
- Outline: #C17735 (brown, subtle)
- Cheeks (blush): #FFB3C1 with transparency

## Design Guidelines
- Consistent character design across all 4 states
- Only facial expression and small details change
- Maintain same pose/position for smooth transitions
- Simple, clean lines
- Friendly, non-threatening appearance
- Gender-neutral design

## Style References
- Inspiration: Japanese kawaii style, emoji, LINE stickers
- Simplicity: minimal details, focus on expression
- Cuteness: rounded shapes, soft colors, big eyes
- Professionalism: polished, clean artwork

## Export Requirements
- Format: PNG
- Resolution: @3x (900×900px)
- **LAYERED EXPORT** - Each state needs TWO files:
  * Body layer (static):
    - cat_normal_body.png
    - cat_calculating_body.png
    - cat_result_body.png
    - cat_error_body.png
  * Arms layer (animated):
    - cat_normal_arms.png
    - cat_calculating_arms.png
    - cat_result_arms.png
    - cat_error_arms.png
- Background: transparent for BOTH layers
- Color profile: sRGB
- Arm layer: ensure proper alignment with body layer
- Optimize for: smooth animation transitions and layer compositing

## Quality Standards
- Consistent style across all 4 states
- Clear emotional expressions
- Professional illustration quality
- Smooth edges (anti-aliased)
- Exact color matching
- Suitable for app store screenshots

## Animation Considerations
- Body layer: NO MOVEMENT, only facial expression changes
- Arms layer: designed for vertical translation animation (up/down)
- Arm pivot point: shoulder area (top of arm)
- Movement range: 20-30px (@3x scale = 60-90px)
- Design should support smooth fade transitions between states
- Keep position/size consistent for morphing
- Clear visual distinction between states
- Expressions easily recognizable at small sizes (100×100pt display)

## Layer Alignment Guide
- Both layers must use same canvas size (300×300px @3x)
- Align body and arms perfectly when layered
- Arms should NOT overlap body outline (draw slightly in front)
- Export with proper registration marks if needed

Create all 4 cat character states as LAYERED illustrations (8 PNG files total: 4 bodies + 4 arms) with these exact specifications.
